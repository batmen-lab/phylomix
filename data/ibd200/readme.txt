**Directory Structure:**

- `mgx/`: Contains metagenomic sequencing data in BIOM format.
- `16s/`: Contains 16S rRNA gene sequencing data in FASTA and BIOM formats.
- `metadata/`: Contains metadata files describing sample information and additional details.
- See readme.txt files in each subdirectory for comprehensive data descriptions.

**Analysis:**

For analysis of the data, you can use various bioinformatics tools and pipelines
suitable for metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene data analysis. Ensure that you properly
preprocess, filter, and align the sequencing reads before conducting downstream analyses
such as taxonomic profiling, diversity analysis, and statistical comparisons.

**Citation:**

If you use the data from the IBD200 dataset in your research, please cite the
original publication and follow any data usage guidelines provided by the project.
